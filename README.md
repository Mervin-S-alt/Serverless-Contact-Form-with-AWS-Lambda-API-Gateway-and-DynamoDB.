# Serverless-Contact-Form-with-AWS-Lambda-API-Gateway-and-DynamoDB.
This project is a serverless contact form built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. API Gateway routes GET requests to serve the HTML form and POST requests to store submissions in DynamoDB via Lambda. It offers scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency without managing servers.
